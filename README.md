The business objective of the marketing analysis using Power BI is to gain insights into the effectiveness of marketing campaigns and to identify opportunities for improving marketing strategies to increase sales and revenue.
The first step in any data analytics project is to prepare the data. This involves importing the data into Power BI, cleaning it by removing missing or invalid values, transforming it to ensure it is in a suitable format for analysis, creating calculated columns and measures using DAX to enhance the data model, and exploring the data using visualizations like scatterplots, histograms, and boxplots to identify patterns and relationships.
